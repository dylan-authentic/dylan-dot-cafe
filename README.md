# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to learn and practice building an application using both Next.js and TypeScript. For implementation, I followed the basic Next.js learning tutorial on [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=next-website). For the TypeScript implementation, I studied and began applying fundamental concepts like type expressions, unions, etc according to [this guide](https://2ality.com/2018/04/type-notation-typescript.html). Typically while learning, I both handwrite and type notes from the topic I'm learning to better understand, and I sometimes post my notes on [the articles section of my website](https://dylan.cafe/articles)

# Styling
While learning, I came across the various ways of styling a Next.js application. The default way taught in the Next.js tutorial is to use css modules. While this works well, I decided to reach for a different css framework instead. I chose to use `Styled-Components` to style this web app. You'll notice a styles folder in the root of the project that contains route-specific styles in which each route of this site has a corresponding styles file that follows the following naming convention: `<route>.styles.ts`. For individual components found within the `components` folder, a corresponding styles file with component-specific styles sits at the root level of that component. Depending on the size of the styles file, I either export a `Styles` object or I export each individual styled component to be used within the react file.
