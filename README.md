# Dylan-Dot-Cafe
This repo contains code for my personal website - [dylan.cafe](https://dylan.cafe).

Currently, this site is not deployed to the link above, as I'm still developing it __(clicking the link above will bring you to a hosted notion website)__. But, to see the work in progress, feel free to clone this repo and run `npm run dev`.

At the moment, the site is pretty much just a static Next.js website. By building the website with Next.js, I've been able to get more familiar with the Next.js ecosystem, file structure, etc.

## To do
As I continue to build out this site, I'll be working on the following:
- [ ] Implementing Styled Components
- [ ] Implementing Media Queries for cross-device compatability
- [ ] Implementing a headless CMS for my blogging/writing page
