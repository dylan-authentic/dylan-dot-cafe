My biggest de-motivator when it comes to working on side projects is the time it takes to complete my ideas. I, like many of you reading this, am guilty of chronic procrastination when it comes to the things that live inside my head. I really enjoy coming up with concepts and ideas and thinking about all the possible ways they could play out. But, unfortunately many of them fall short of ever existing in reality.
This isn’t all bad though. Plenty of the “next-big-thing” ideas that cross my mind are realistically nothing but an entertaining thought. But, as an entrepreneur and growing developer, the practice of building, releasing, testing, and learning might be one of the most important aspects of your journey. So, when it comes to working on side projects, I highly recommend creating a process that works for you. One that brings down the overall complexity of your ideas to a small, executable action plan. And, one that allows you to work through problems and learning curves relatively quickly.

From my personal experience, this looks like rapidly writing code — in some cases disregarding code quality — in order to get to a tangible version of my idea. I find I am most motivated to continue a project when I toss out all the pressure to write perfect code and focus solely on building the thing that’s so interesting to me in the first place — the product idea. This lets me try new tools, frameworks, and libraries as I see fit, without worrying about building a perfect codebase to start. I also get the visual satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life, plus the satisfaction and feedback of showing friends and family what I’m working on. This is the first phase of my process when working on an interesting side project.

At this point in the process, the second phase of development, refactoring, comes naturally. By this time, I can see a small, working version of my idea, I can see the potential of it, and, most importantly, I can decide if it’s something to keep working on as a worthwhile microstartup, or if it’s something to simply add to my portfolio/tech stack. When it’s something worthwhile, the next best thing to do as an indie hacker is to refactor!! Trust me, I understand refactoring is not the most fun and exciting thing to do. But, from my experience, refactoring your codebase is one of the most beneficial ways to speed up your development time once you have a working version of your project. Here’s a few benefits:
You increase iteration speed of your product by making it easier to add new features
You gain a much clearer understanding of the technologies you’re using
And, you find better ways to build your idea

Obviously, any critic of this process would say “wHy NoT jUsT WRiTe beTteR cOde tO beGin wiTh?” *Insert spongebob meme* — but, my argument would be that’s not the point of side projects to begin with, at least for programmers like myself who are most interested in building rather than optimizing code. Like I mentioned before, find a process that works for you that keeps you motivated and helps you see your ideas to completion!
