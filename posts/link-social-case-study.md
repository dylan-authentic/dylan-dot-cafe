#### The Idea
The idea behind link social is to build a scheduling tool to maintain on-going relationships with friends, family, and other connections in your social circle. 

*Disclaimer:* This is just a product idea used to build a product management case study

#### Overview
As a young professional in a digitally-connected world, maintaining a well-balanced social life and a busy professional, family, and personal life has become increasingly difficult to achieve. With a growing list of responsibilities, time-consuming ambitions, and a false sense of genuine connection created by social media performance culture, finding time for valuable friendships and genuine interactions between important people in one's life presents a challenge. Link Social aims to provide tools to facilitate healthy, personal interactions between friends, family, and other connections in one's social circle.

#### Problem Discovery
###### Customer Interview Questions
- Q: What's the hardest part about keeping in touch with friends and other connections in your social circle?
- Q: What was the feeling you experienced when you last noticed that difficulty?
- Q: What about the situation made you feel that way?
- Q: How did you proceed the last time you encountered that problem?
- Q: What bothers you most when you face this problem?

###### Customer Painpoints
- I'm generally busy with work and finding time to connect with friends is difficult
- I don't know when's the best time to reach out to people who are also busy, and I don't want to be a bother
- It can be annoying to go back and forth with people to schedule hangouts, chats, etc
- I'm an introvert and I don't naturally like to initiate contact with new friends I may be getting to know

###### Problem Statement
*I am* a young professional *trying to* maintain an active social life *but* it's difficult to keep in touch with friends and connections *because* we're all busy with our careers and personal responsibilities, *or* we don't live in the same city anymore

###### Business Case
**Competitive Opportunity**
- The current market for social networking tools is primarily dominated by Facebook, Inc. and Facebook's corresponding properties including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook.com. Other competitors in the space include Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, and LinkedIn. These products are primarily used for media and entertainment purposes, such as video and photo sharing and text-based microblogging and commenting. Other than LinkedIn which is used specifically for professional purposes, social media platforms aren't typically used to maintain 1-to-1 personal interactions between friends. Instead, social media allows for 1-to-many interactions where content is broadcasted and followers can comment and like. 

- Because of this focus on 1-to-many interactions within the current landscape of social media, I believe there exists a competitive opportunity for a tool that facilitates more personal, 1-to-1 interactions amongst an individuals social circle. This tool would benefit from similar network effects of traditional social media platforms, as each additional user that finds value from the service would more than likely introduce the service to an additional network of friends.

**Revenue Generation**
- As a SaaS product, revenue will be generated through monthly subscription packages. Initially, the product will launch with 1 package available for the core scheduling service. This package will be optimized for organic growth and priced at $2.99/mo. The product will come with a free trial period in which a user will be able to use the product for free for a certain amount of days. After that, a user can purchase a paid subscription to continue using the product.

**Associated Risks**
- *Demand Risk:* With a number of social media platforms existing in the market, consumers may be hesitant to start using a new tool in addition to the many apps they may already be using. To mitigate this risk, Link Social is being built as a SaaS application for connecting with friends, rather than as a social media app for sharing, following, liking, etc. 

- *Price Risk:* Traditionally, consumers are used to free software services. Due to the business model of Link Social being a subscription service, consumers may be hesitant to pay for the tool. To mitigate this risk, consumers will be offered free tiers to trial the product and begin receiving value prior to making any payment. A second mitigation tactic is to keep the price of the service low enough to get customer buy-in, yet high enough to have an impact as network effects kick in.

- *Customer Experience:* The experience of connecting with friends will be a challenging one to design. The product must be easy enough to begin receiving value right away, and the experience must be intuitive enough to continue using the product. It must also be simple enough to allow for people unfamiliar to the service to complete/accept invites and understand what actions they must take next. In other words, the product and experience should be self-explanatory for anyone interacting with it.
